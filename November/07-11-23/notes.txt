//Writing method inside the class 
class Vehicle{
    setMarkDetails(input){
        this.marks = input;
    }
    getMarks(){
        return this.marks;
    }
}
//any method written inside the class will be created single instance 
//It means if you create multiple object also it will reuse one single method.


writing method inside the es5 
Prototype:
//Inside all the object Prototype is present
//It consists of inbuilt functionality for object 
//example constructor method is present.
//we can create your own method and property inside the prototype 
//It will create only one instance of that method.
example:
   function Student(name){
        this.name = name;     
    }
    Student.prototype.marksDisplay = function(input){
        this.marks = input;
    }
