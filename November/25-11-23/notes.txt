Synchronous and Asynchronous 
Synchronous - line by line execution 
Asynchronous - 
//first come first serve
//whenever code is ready to execute it will execute the code otherwise it will run in the back
javascript will give priority to Synchronous code first then only Asynchronous.
example:
1.setimeout 
2.setinterval 
3.callback 
4.promise 
5.async-await 
6.fetch

Javascript Engine 
1.call stack 
   //main execution will happen inside the call stack 
   //for every program in one global function will be created inside the call stack 
   //for each function execution context will be created inside the call stack 
   //execution context is nothing but combination of function,scope chain and arguments details  
   //anonymous is global execution context 
   //FILO
2.callback queue 
//all Asynchronous code once it is completed will come and sit here 
//once call stack is empty then callback queue code will be give to call stack 
//FIFO
3.web api 
   //Inbuilt functions will be present 
   example; 
       1.DOM 
       2.timers 
       3.fetch
