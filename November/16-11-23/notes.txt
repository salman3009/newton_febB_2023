0.single instance of data will be there inside the prototype
1.For every object will have default prototype 
2.we have following inbuilt methods inside the prototype
example:
constructor 
get 
set 
toString
3.default prototype is finally connect to null
4.Object.create() method will help to inherit another object.
5.Object.create() method will put entire object inside the prototype of newly created object.
6.Each object is connected with nested prototype object this concept is called prototype chain.
example:object --> default prototype --> null 
7.to check prototype chain we can use below method 
example:Object.getPrototypeOf()
8.to check whether any property in object belong to them or it is coming from prototype object 
example:object.hasOwnProperty()
true --> It belongs to that object 
false --> It is coming from prototype object 
9.__proto__ it is use to check prototype chain 
10.__proto__ it helps to inherit any object to another object which is already created after constructor function 
11.prototype we can use in constructor function to attach prototype properties.
