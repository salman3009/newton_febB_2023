1.For every object will have default prototype 
2.we have following inbuilt methods inside the prototype
example:
constructor 
get 
set 
toString
3.default prototype is finally connect to null
4.Object.create() method will help to inherit another object.
5.Object.create() method will put entire object inside the prototype of newly created object.
6.Each object is connected with nested prototype object this concept is called prototype chain.
example:object --> default prototype --> null 
7.to check prototype chain we can use below method 
example:Object.getPrototypeOf()
8.to check whether any property in object belong to them or it is coming from prototype object 
example:object.hasOwnProperty()
true --> It belongs to that object 
false --> It is coming from prototype object 

===========================================
To check prototype chain we can use below method:
 Object.getPrototypeOf()
 ========================================================
__proto__
//proto helps to reuse the object created after constructor function or any static object 
//By using proto we can find the prototype chain of each object.
