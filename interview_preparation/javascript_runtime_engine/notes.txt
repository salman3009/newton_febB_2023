What are primitives datatypes?
1.string - character/string
2.number  - float/integer
3.boolean 
4.undefined 
What are non-primitive or dervied datatype?
1.array  - dynamic size
2.object  - dynamic size
3.null - null is empty object
What are empty datatypes in javascript?
1.undefined
2.null
what is the difference between == and === operator?
== only check only value 
=== only check value and datatype 
what are false value?
1.false
2.undefined 
3.null 
4.NaN 
5.'' or ""
6.0
what is the difference between single quotes('') and double quotes("")
//There is no difference inside the javascript. For string either you can use single or double quotes.
Whenever we copy array or object using assignment operator. It will do deep copy or reference copy or shallow copy?
deep copy - every variable will have separate memory space 
shallow copy - will refer to same memory space.
================================================================================
Javascript in the Browser:
//chrome v8 engine 
//firefox spider engine
Overall structure compiler or Javascript Runtime
1.call stack - FILO - main execution will happen inside the call stack.
//any code you have written. first it will reach call stack.
2.heap - array and object will get store and it will be given to call stack as reference
3.webapi - It will provide support for all inbuilt methods example:DOM
4.callback queue (FIFO) - all async code will get store here.
//waiting time set of code will be kept inside this queue.
5.event loop - it will run 24*7 to check incoming and outcoming data. And it will manage the entire flow.
//taking data from call stack to callback queue 
//taking data from queue to call stack
=============================================
heap - object/array
call stack - main execution
webapi - DOM
callback queue - data store for late response
event loop - manager
=============================================
javascript - single threaded
thread - space to execute the code
each tab will have - one thread
single thread benefits:
1.memory utilization
2.performance improvement 
=========================================
call stack - execution context 
Inside the execution context 
1.what are the data you have declare, functions,object,variable
2.what is the scope of data
3.this keyword - current object
//before we run the code global execution context will be created
//Inside the global execution context all global variable and function will get registered inside this.
//each function is a execution context 
//inside browser anonymous is nothing but a global execution context

=======================================
Hoisting:
1.call function or variable before declaration this concept is called hoisting.
2.because of global execution context that is stored before running the code.
3.Inside the global execution context you will have data above all function and variables.
example;
<script>
    addition();
    function addition(){
        console.log("addition function");
    }
 
</script>
==============================================
what is hoisting?
//before function declaration we can able to call the function 
How hositing is possible?
//Because of global execution context 
//Global execution context will store global variables and function name will be registered here.
//Global execution context will stored all data before code execution start.
//so function can able to call before declaration.
