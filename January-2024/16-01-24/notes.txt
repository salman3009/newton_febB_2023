Pokemon Project:
1.This Pokemon project we need to display a list of pokemon cards 
2.This project consists of two api to fetch the data 
3.first api will bring list of url to get details information about each pokemon 
4.We need to call first api and then we need to call one by one given url api 
5.we need to store this data inside the state 
6.To call nested api we are using for await keyword so that it will wait for next course of data 
7.we are using map function to display the data 
8.once you click on more pokemon button will bring next 20 new data 
9.next 20 new data will get url from previous api and will store in the state 
10.once we click on load more will get the index value and will display that particular data 
11.once we click on load more we are not calling any api because we need api initial load itself to display few of the data inside the cards 
12.for design we have use flex box and simple modal popup
